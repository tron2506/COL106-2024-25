Q. definition of maximal connected subgraphs?
A. connected components are also called maximal connected subgraphs.

q. what are the applications of bfs- 
1. no of connected components(can also be found by dfs)
2. shortest path.
3. whether graph is bipartite
4. cycle detection in undirected graphs
5. level order traversal of trees

Q. Also in lec 25 what is the role of Pi which stores the parent of a node (the parent through which it entered the bfs)

Q. BFS algorithm screenshot at 41.25 in lec 25
